makefile format.

Important files and directories

# config.mk
This is the default configuration. DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE. You can use this
file as a template to create your own configuration.

# modules
This is the modules directory. It has the configuration file for each module
that is available through Distillery.

# local
This directory (may or may not exist) is the place to put your local
configuration files. It gets ignored by git.  Make will look for a
configuration file called config.mk in this directory to configure this
specific instance of Distillery.
